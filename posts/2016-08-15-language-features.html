            <h1>Powerful Language Features</h1>

            <div class="info">

<p>There are a number of language features that are very powerful but have been largely unnoticed by the larger developer community. Here are some of the ones I really like that I wish the larger programming community was more aware of.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><i class="fa-li fa fa-code"></i> <strong>Deconstructing Types</strong><br />
In ML-based languages which have algebraic data types, you can deconstruct types cased on their constructors when patterm matching. In Haskell totality is not enforced so you can do this with let expressions as well. This is not possible in common languages like Java, where it’s impossible to generally get the values used to construct a type given the type alone.</p></li>
<li><p><i class="fa-li fa fa-code"></i> <strong>Destructuring Containers</strong><br />
In languages like Python or ES6, you can destructure types very elegantly. In Python you can unpack tuples, and in ES6 you can unpack JSON objects. This can save you from writing a lot of ugly boilerplate code.</p></li>
<li><p><i class="fa-li fa fa-code"></i> <strong>Pattern Matching</strong><br />
Depending on the language, pattern matching might be nothing but syntactic sugar for case expressions or conditionals, but the strongest implmenetation of this feature is magnitudes more powerful than conditional statements most developers are aware of:</p>
<ul>
<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-code"></i> <strong>Exhaustive pattern matching</strong> - The cases all have to be different, and they must handle all possible cases for that type or set of types, and if it doesn’t then the compiler throws an error. This is an incredibly powerful feature because it enforces total functions, which means that all of your code is well defined for all sets of inputs. This prevents a lot of errors that developers might inadvertently introduce into their code. Ocaml and Purescript enforce this, but Haskell unfortunately doesn’t, which is a big criticism against Haskell.<br />
 <br />
</li>
<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-code"></i> <strong>Deconstructing types</strong> - You can deconstruct types when pattern matching, which means that you can match on a particular constructor in a sum type, or to test a predicate for a type deep inside an algebraic data type in a very elegant way. Combined with exhaustive matching, it ensures that you can write very expressive and safe code.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><i class="fa-li fa fa-code"></i> <strong>Tagged Sum Types</strong><br />
Most developers are familiar with it’s weakly typed sibling called untagged sum types or union types. The tag in tagged sums means that it’s possible to pattern match and deconstruct on a sum type, making it strongly typed since the information on which type is contained within is not lost.</p></li>
<li><p><i class="fa-li fa fa-code"></i> <strong>Option Types</strong><br />
Option types are incredibly useful. Most languages have null or undefined as a special value in the language, but in ML-based languages the concept of nothing is encoded at the type level. This is much more powerful for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-code"></i> You know where the nothing value is coming from. So if it’s Maybe a string or Maybe an integer, the Nothing value in both cases is enforced by the type. So if you have a function that accepts a Maybe String, but you give it a Maybe Int which is a Nothing, then this would throw a compile-time error since the types don’t match. In a language without option types, it’s often be much harder to track down where the null value got introduced and it’s much easier to introduce bugs into the code because the type is less refined.<br />
 <br />
</li>
<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-code"></i> You can pattern match against option types. Combined with enforced exhaustive pattern matching, you get an incredible amount of type safety. This actually eliminates an entire class of errors called null pointer errors, which are actually fairly common in languages without option types.<br />
 <br />
</li>
<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-code"></i> In conjunction with exhaustive pattern matching, you can also elminate another entire class of errors called hash or array index out of bounds errors, by introducing safe accessor functions for hash or array types that return a Maybe value.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><i class="fa-li fa fa-code"></i> <strong>Enforced Totality and Purity</strong><br />
The combination of enforced totality and purely functional code actually does something that a lot of developers think is impossible: it completely eliminates the possibility of runtime errors.</p></li>
<li><p><i class="fa-li fa fa-code"></i> <strong>Generative Testing</strong><br />
In a lot of traditional languages writing unit tests is often a time consuming, error prone and verbose process. With generative testing like Quickcheck, you can have the language write the tests for you. Although this is a library feature, this kind of testing is really made very useful because Haskell is purely functional, so side effecting functions can be tested by creating Pure values which would be impossible without some kind of mocking library in other languages. The need for testing, including generative testing, can even be eliminated with the introduction of refinement and dependent types.</p></li>
<li><p><i class="fa-li fa fa-code"></i> <strong>Refinement Types</strong><br />
Refinement types are a form of predicate based subtyping. This is the programmers equivalent to set builder notation coming from set theory. These types can prevent a lot of boilerplate code that would be written to ensure type safety. For example, if you have a function that can only take positive integers, then without refinement types you would need to handle the case when the user doesn’t provide a positive integer, which would make the type signature of the function more complex because it would need to return a Maybe, Either, or Except type. With refinement types, this type burden is instead given to the caller to the function.<br />
 <br />
Refinement types also eliminate the need for generative tests because the predicates are already encoded in the types. Together with functional purity and enforced totality, this eliminates the need for any tests except as a form of documentation, which elminates what’s usually a massive burden in modern web development.</p></li>
<li><p><i class="fa-li fa fa-code"></i> <strong>Dependent Types</strong><br />
Dependent types also eliminate the need for generative tests, because instead of writing tests, you actually <em>prove</em> that your functions behave the way you want them to. One downside to generative tests is that it generates a random sample of values for the given types, so it’s possible that the generated tests won’t reach a potential corner case and error out. You can compensate for this by increasing the sample size of the generative tests, but with proofs this isn’t an issue. The downside with using proofs in code is that writing proofs for code is often not easy to do. This is still a very active field, with the Idris language leading it. A popular idea for this common problem is to provide reusable proofs that programmers can leverage.<br />
 <br />
A lot of proofs have already been developed in this way in Idris. So for example, if you write a Monoid in Haskell, there’s nothing in the language that can enforce that your type satisfies the Monoid laws. There are generative tests that you can leverage to check if your Monoid does satisfy them, but this isn’t a proof. In Idris, you can verify that your Monoid satisfies the laws by implementing the VerifiedMonoid typeclass for your type.</p></li>
<li><p><i class="fa-li fa fa-code"></i> <strong>Linear Types</strong><br />
Haskell and Purescript use Monads to encode side effects and retain purity. But there’s another popular approach which is to use linear types. Linear types are also called uniqueness types because they enforce at compile time that the type can be used once and only once.<br />
 <br />
Rust uses a flavor of linear types called affine types, which can be used only 0-1 times. So for example, when opening a file in Rust in contrast to C, you can enforce at <em>compile-time</em> that the file cannot be used after it’s closed. In C there’s nothing stopping you from trying to do something with a clsoed FILE handle.</p></li>
<li><p><i class="fa-li fa fa-code"></i> <strong>Immutability</strong><br />
Functional languages enforce immutability as part of the language because they are higher level in terms in abstraction since they are declarative in nature. This is a particularly valuable asset when it comes to concurrent programming. These days almost all applications are web applications or written in web languages like Javascript. Both frontend and backend programming is heavily concurrent, so having this kind of guarantee can eliminate a lot of errors. By having enforced immutability, you don’t need special constructs like mutexes and semaphores to prevent race conditions in your code because all of the code is declarative in nature. Sometimes resources do need to be shared, so some languages like Clojure provide special reference types called atoms which have some transactional guarantees like those you see in database languages.</p></li>
<li><p><i class="fa-li fa fa-code"></i> <strong>Distributed Programming</strong><br />
Some languages have very nice support for distributed programming built in directly into the language. Erlang makes this very easy, and provides really nice features such as fault tolerance, fast lightweight processes, and actors to make this kind of programming as painless as possible.<br />
 <br />
A new language in the horizon called Unison allows nodes to reference functions from other nodes. The way you might handle this normally is to send the code in the body of an HTTP request and then eval the code on the other end. But this approach is very unsafe, and Unison has some built-in features to ensure that the code sharing it provides is safe. Another nice feature of this is an always-online feature of the code, where you can live update code without turning off the server temporarily. If you update a function, then any code still referencing the old function remains unchanged, which means that live updating code remains safe. This opens up a whole new world of distributed programming, and it’s potential is currently being actively researched.</p></li>
<li><p><i class="fa-li fa fa-code"></i> <strong>Macros</strong><br />
The nicest and most talked about feature of Lisp languages is it’s homoiconicity. What this means is that the code is data, and specifically with lisp, which is made up of S-expressions, these S-expressions can be thought of as lists. Hence the term Lisp (list processor). This makes Lisp macros more powerful and expressive than other language out there, because you can handle any piece of code as if it’s a list and transform it into some other structure to be evaluated.<br />
 <br />
There are two types of macros, regular macros and reader macros. Regular macros get evaluated and expanded at runtime. The benefit of this is that any information that would only be available at runtime can be used in the macro. The drawback is that you can’t extend the compiler with this approach since it’s not at compile time. Reader macros get evaluated at compile time, which effectively gives you the ability to extend the language with the simplicity and elegance that Lisp macros offer. Clojure provides limited support for reader macros but Racket has full support for them.</p></li>
<li><p><i class="fa-li fa fa-code"></i> <strong>More Powerful Polymorphism</strong><br />
The way most people are familiar with polymorphism is the Java style of it called parametric polymorphism. So if you wanted to write a polymorphic class, you would write it like <code>Object&lt;T&gt;</code>, where T is the parameterized polymorphic type.<br />
 <br />
But languages like Haskell and Purescript provide more powerful parametric and ad-hoc polymorphism. For example, you can write functions that work on types that accept a constructor of any type. A type with this kind of signature is compeltely okay: <code>foo :: f a -&gt; f b -&gt; f c</code>, where <code>f</code>, <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code> are all polymoprhic types but also potentially distinct types and is enforced by the compiler. This level of expressiveness is not possible with the polymoprhism most people are familiar with.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These are some features that are developed by libraries but are also be built into languages like Elm:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><i class="fa-li fa fa-code"></i> <strong>Time Travel Debugging</strong><br />
With Elm and libraries such as Redux and Pux, you can use a time travel debugger. What this lets you do is undo events that got fired, so that you can literally go back in time. This is incredibly useful for debugging event streams.</p></li>
<li><p><i class="fa-li fa fa-code"></i> <strong>Hot Module Reloading</strong><br />
Hot module reloading sets up a websocket server so that when you save your code, the server automatically compiles and runs the code and the code automatically updates in the browser (or terminal in the case of Figwheel) without having to reload anything. The best part about this is that the state is preserved. This speeds up development time substantially. Elm, Pux, and Webpack have this feature, but Figwheel is more powerful than all of these because it works on NodeJS also.</p></li>
<li><p><i class="fa-li fa fa-code"></i> <strong>Proof By Construction Editing</strong><br />
The Unison language also provides another very interesting feature as an editor, which is that code is written by construction rather than treated as ascii or unicode strings. The way we’re used to writing code is by writing some strings of code in a file, compiling our code, and then if there’s a compile-time error, going back and trying to fix the code, and repeating this process until it works.<br />
 <br />
This process is time consuming and completely unnecessary. With Unison’s editor, you don’t write strings that may or may not be correct syntactically and semantically. Instead, Unison only lets you type in values that are correct as far as the compiler is concerned, which saves a lot of developer time.<br />
 <br />
This concept isn’t new. A lot of languages that are used for educational purposes, such as the Lego Mindstorms language, is graphical in nature, and only lets you combine pieces that work together. This is a lot like that except the feature is more similar to autocomplete in your usual IDEs.</p></li>
