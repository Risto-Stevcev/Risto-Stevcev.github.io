This blog is focused on a lot of the topics I find interesting. Some of my current interests are:

- Functional programming. Web apps took over standalone apps long ago, and modern frontend and backend programming is very concurrent in nature. FP is almost always the right choice.
- Code design and architecture. In particular, I'm fascinated with functional languages and techniques and how they can make large production applications scalable, modular, safe, decomposable, extendable and maintable.
- Parsers and language theory. The flexibility of homoiconic languages such as the Lisp family, algebraic data types, dependent types, exhaustive pattern matching, code analysis tools, parser combinators, and so on.
- Linux systems. In my opinion it is the most powerful OS type for developers and those that like to tinker with tech.
